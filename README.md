I'm a Data Engineer with experience building reliable, scalable, and cloud-native data pipelines. I love working with Python, SQL, Airflow, and cloud tools (Azure & AWS) to extract insights from complex data.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, R
- **Cloud:** Azure (Data Factory, ADLS, Databricks), AWS (S3, Glue, Lambda, Athena)
- **Big Data:** Apache Airflow, Hive, PySpark, HDFS
- **Databases:** MySQL, Snowflake, SQL Server
- **Visualization:** Tableau, QuickSight

## ðŸ“Œ Projects
- **E-commerce Pipeline:** Designed a modular and scalable data pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Delta Lake to automate ingestion, transformation, and analytics for e-commerce data. Implemented a medallion architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold) and integrated with Tableau for real-time business insights.
- **API-to-S3 Pipeline:** Built an automated ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract product data from RapidAPI, transform it using pandas, and load it into AWS S3 in Parquet format. Included daily scheduling and email alerting.
- **YouTube Analytics:** Serverless ETL pipeline using AWS S3, Glue, Lambda, and Athena to process and analyze nested YouTube JSON/CSV data across multiple regions. Leveraged S3 triggers and Lambda functions for real-time transformation into Parquet, and visualized insights via Amazon QuickSight
- **Investment DB:** Designed a relational MySQL database to manage portfolio and transaction data efficiently. Normalized schema design improved query performance by 30%, while stored procedures and triggers enforced data integrity, reducing anomalies and ensuring reliable reporting.
